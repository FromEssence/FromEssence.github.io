## Beginner

### TIPS AND TRICKS

#### Instruction
​	There's a server listening on some tcp port. When a new connection comes in, it responces with a text containing a math addition problem. The client will receive the flag after it answers correctly for the whole 500 questions.

#### Analysis

​	It's unrealistic to send answers by hand, so we should write a simple client which reads questions, computes answers and sends back, over and over again.

``` python
import socket
s = socket.socket(2, 1)
host = '728d1bbe8df32a68.247ctf.com'
port = 50277
s.connect((host, port))

for i in range(500):
    msg = s.recv(1024)
    print(msg)
    ques = msg.decode('utf-8').split('\r\n')[-2]
    segs = ques.split(' ')
    a = int(segs[-3])
    b = int(segs[-1][0:-1])
    print(a+b)
    
    # attention! '\r\n' should be added, simulating a person pressing enter key.
    s.send((str(a+b)+'\r\n').encode('utf-8')) 

flag = s.recv(1024).decode()
print(flag)
s.close()

```

## Networking
### ERROR REPORTING PROTOCOL
#### Instruction
​    Download the tcpdump file and identify the flag hidden within the error messages of this ICMP traffic.

#### Analysis

1. Find where and what the error is.
    ![01](/public/blog-imgs/247ctf/01.png)

2. Why error ?

   In `echo(ping)`, `ICMP` uses `id` and `seq` to identify and match request and reply. Also, `ICMP` will try to match the `data` field between request and reply. Under default setting, those two data field are the same , as the name `echo` imply. So, if there is not a match for some req, it reports a warning.

3. What to do ? 

   Data in echo reply changed, so maybe some information is hidden in the payload. In Wireshark we can see the payload in echo request is "Send the flag !", and payload in the first reply have "JFIF" in it, which means reply is an image.
    ![02](/public/blog-imgs/247ctf/02.png)
    ![03](/public/blog-imgs/247ctf/03.png)
   Now we should concatenate all ICMP reply payloads to one file.

```python
# python3
import dpkt

in_pcap=open("error_reporting.pcap", "rb")

# going to extract all ICMP payloads and concatenate them in_pcap one file
output=open("output.jpg", "bw")
pcap=dpkt.pcap.Reader(in_pcap)

# The parsed packets in the dpkt.pcap.Reader contains two members: "ts" and "buf".
# The member "ts" is just the timestamp which lived in_pcap the packet when captured
# by Wireshark; it is the clock when captured this packet. The member "buf" holds
# the real packet data captured by capture tool, it's the raw traffic data.
for ts, buf in pcap:
    eth=dpkt.ethernet.Ethernet(buf)
    if (eth.type != 2048): # 2048 is the code for IPv4
        continue

    ip=eth.data
    icmp=ip.data

    if (ip.p==dpkt.ip.IP_PROTO_ICMP) and len(icmp.data.data)>0:
        output.write(icmp.data.data)

in_pcap.close()
output.close()

```

Now we get the img and can see flag after opening it .

### Not my Modulus
#### Instruction
We are trying to decrypt a packet capture taken on our internal network. We know you can decrypt the data using the correct private key, but we simply have too many. Can you identify the correct key? (pcap file and many private keys provided.)

#### Analysis
1. Where is the target data ?
  Two stages in TLS have encrypted data. 

  | stage                     | encrypted data                                     | key                                  |
  | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
  | application data transfer | application data                                   | session key<br />(can't be captured) |
  | handshake                 | PreMaster secret<br />(for session key generating) | server public key                    |
  | handshake                 | encrypted handshake message                        | session key                          |

  I know flag can be in application data, but ``not sure`` if it can be hidden in handshake premaster or encrypted handshake msg. Fortunately, all three above can be decrypted cause we are provided the server private key.

2. how to decrypt ?

   Premaster secret can be decrypted using correct private key, and what's better is that wireshark can compute session keys as well given the private key.

3. how to match RSA key pairs ?

   Modulus in private key and public key should be the same.
   
   ```shell
   #!/bin/bash
   
   PUB_KEY_MODULUS=$(openssl x509 -inform der -in cert.der -noout -modulus | openssl md5 )
   echo $PUB_KEY_MODULUS
   for filename in keys/*; do
       PRIVATE_KEY_MODULUS=$(openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in $filename | openssl md5)
       if [ "$PUB_KEY_MODULUS" = "$PRIVATE_KEY_MODULUS" ]; then
           echo
           echo $filename
       fi
       break
   done
   ```
   
   
   
4. how to decrypt packets in wireshark ?

   Details in [8]. One thing important is that the`` debug file`` field is better not left empty. Even given wrong actual tls port, wireshark can print correct decrypted data in the debug file.

#### Some confusions when solving
Q1: In the pcap file I see Encrypt Alert before TCP FIN, and if looking into it ,I see "Content Type: Alert(21)" in wireshark. When refering to RFC 5246, I see in section 7.2 Alert "decryption_failed_RESERVED(21)" . So why decryption failed in this pcap, what happened ?
A1: Actually I've mistaken the meaning of "Content Type: Alert(21)". It means "The higher-level protocol used to process the enclosed fragment."[3]. In other words, it says that part is an alert, but the alert is encrypted, so we can't see the alert type.

### Multiplication Tables

#### Instruction

Can you recover the private key we used to download the flag over a TLS encrypted connection?

#### Analysis
What we can only do is to try to get the private key.
Already have:

``` shell
1) public key of server. (from certificate)
```

Now think how to compute the private key...

here use tool[2], which get the private key in this problem by `Fermat Factorization`.

step 1 : get public key from certificate

​```shell
$ openssl x509 -inform DER -in cert.der -pubkey -noout > key.pub
```



step 2: install related package ——`pycryptodome`



step 3 : cracking

```shelll
$ python ./RsaCtfTool-master/RsaCtfTool.py --publickey key.pub --private --attack factordb
[*] Testing key key.pub.
[*] Performing factordb attack on key.pub.

Results for key.pub:

Private key :
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIICXQIBAAKBgQDVzrM58EOtSsBE5WgLJiNjPa/hZtArVRS0PjS01u6DyAlvAWwm
...
```

Then we can decrypt the TLS traffic.

### Custom Protocol





## WEB

### Trusted Client

#### Instruction

Developers don't always have time to setup a backend service when prototyping code. Storing credentials on the client side should be fine as long as it's obfuscated right?

#### Analysis

1. What info we can get now : 

``` shell
1. "obfuscated" must imply something.
2. We can see long strange characters in JS.
3. Input any username and pass, an alert occurs. But see the JS, no "alert" is found. So there must be something executed in the strange JS. Actually the js  is obfuscated.
```

2. Next we should know know what obfuscated algo used. After searching, we know it's JSFuck.

   So just find an online decoder**(Be careful that the obfuscated js code you copy may have spaces, you should delete them by using regular expression and replace ``\s`` to ``\0``)**. en 

   Then we get the flag.

### Secured Session

#### Instruction

If you can guess our random secret key, we will tell you the flag securely stored in your session

#### Analysis

What we know is that flag is in something called "session". 

Open the web, we are shown is server side code using  flask:

```python
import os
from flask import Flask, request, session
from flag import flag

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.urandom(24)

def secret_key_to_int(s):
    try:
        secret_key = int(s)
    except ValueError:
        secret_key = 0
    return secret_key

@app.route("/flag")
def index():
    secret_key = secret_key_to_int(request.args['secret_key']) if 'secret_key' in request.args else None
    session['flag'] = flag
    if secret_key == app.config['SECRET_KEY']:
      return session['flag']
    else:
      return "Incorrect secret key!"

@app.route('/')
def source():
    return "
%s
" % open(__file__).read()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

The logic above is easy. Only if requesting `/flag` page with `?secret_key=` plus string same as `app.config['SECRET_KEY']` will the flag be returned . But no enough info we can't guess the random number. 

We note  that session in web related to cookie. , maybe flag is in the cookie. press ` F12` there is no cookie set by this site. 

But after trying to request page `/flag?secret_key=123`  we get a cookie. That is because `session` module set the `flag` into cookie. 

Now what matters is the format of cookie. From [2] we learn cookie set by flask is `signed cookie`, which is `content+secure_hash(content, key)`. `signature`  ensures integrity so that an attacker can't modify it. But, no confidentiality ensured so ***anyone can see*** the content.

encoded by base64 , we can decode it again by base64 and then get the flag. 

code:

``` python
import base64

# note I add a '=' at the end, cause '=' maybe omited .
# '=' has special defalt meaning in URL and cookie, so omited
cookie_b64 = base64.b64decode('eyJmbGFnIjp7IiBiIjoiTWpRM1ExUkdlMlJoT0RBM09UVm1PR0UxWTJGaU1tVXdNemRrTnpNNE5UZ3dOMkk1WVRreGZRPT0ifX0=')
print(base64.b64decode(cookie_b64))

```

### Compare the Pair

#### Instruction 

Can you identify a way to bypass our login logic? MD5 is supposed to be a one-way function rightiece

The web page is piece of authentication code .

``` php
<?php
  require_once('flag.php');
  $password_hash = "0e902564435691274142490923013038";
  $salt = "f789bbc328a3d1a3";
  if(isset($_GET['password']) && md5($salt . $_GET['password']) == $password_hash){
    echo $flag;
  }
  echo highlight_file(__FILE__, true);
?>
```

#### Analysis

The aim is to crack the md5 given salt value and hash value . 

From [1] I know that there is a **"php type juggling bug"** . 

> In php, loose comparison `==` will do type juggling . 
>
> 1) When comparing a string to a number, PHP will attempt to convert the string to a number then perform a numeric comparison.
>
> 2)  If PHP decides that both operands look like numbers, even if they are actually strings, it will convert them both and perform a numeric comparison.

Here, `md5` return a string, but note that `$password_hash` is a string of format `0e+nums` . So if we can find a string s satisfy : `md5(s+salt)` is also "0e+nums", then php will compare them as numbers, which are all 0 



Exploit code[2]:

```python
from itertools import product
import hashlib # Import the modules

alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"
for x in range(0, 10): # Iterate through the lengths
    # For each combination in this alphabet with this length
        for combo in product(alphabet, repeat=x): 
                result = hashlib.md5("f789bbc328a3d1a3" + ''.join(combo)).hexdigest() 
                if result.startswith("0e") and result[2:].isdigit(): 
                        print "f789bbc328a3d1a3" + ''.join(combo) 
                        exit(0)
                else:
                        pass #If not pass
```
