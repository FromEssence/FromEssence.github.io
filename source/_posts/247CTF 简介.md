### TIPS AND TRICKS

#### Description
​	There's a server listening on some tcp port. When a new connection comes in, it responces with a text containing a math addition problem. The client will receive the flag after it answers correctly for the whole 500 questions.

#### Analysis

​	It's unrealistic to send answers by hand, so we should write a simple client which reads questions, computes answers and sends back, over and over again.

``` python
import socket
s = socket.socket(2, 1)
host = '728d1bbe8df32a68.247ctf.com'
port = 50277
s.connect((host, port))

for i in range(500):
    msg = s.recv(1024)
    print(msg)
    ques = msg.decode('utf-8').split('\r\n')[-2]
    segs = ques.split(' ')
    a = int(segs[-3])
    b = int(segs[-1][0:-1])
    print(a+b)
    
    # attention! '\r\n' should be added, simulating a person pressing enter key.
    s.send((str(a+b)+'\r\n').encode('utf-8')) 

flag = s.recv(1024).decode()
print(flag)
s.close()

```
