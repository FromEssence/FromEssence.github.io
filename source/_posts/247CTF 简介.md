## Beginner

### TIPS AND TRICKS

#### Instruction
​	There's a server listening on some tcp port. When a new connection comes in, it responces with a text containing a math addition problem. The client will receive the flag after it answers correctly for the whole 500 questions.

#### Analysis

​	It's unrealistic to send answers by hand, so we should write a simple client which reads questions, computes answers and sends back, over and over again.

``` python
import socket
s = socket.socket(2, 1)
host = '728d1bbe8df32a68.247ctf.com'
port = 50277
s.connect((host, port))

for i in range(500):
    msg = s.recv(1024)
    print(msg)
    ques = msg.decode('utf-8').split('\r\n')[-2]
    segs = ques.split(' ')
    a = int(segs[-3])
    b = int(segs[-1][0:-1])
    print(a+b)
    
    # attention! '\r\n' should be added, simulating a person pressing enter key.
    s.send((str(a+b)+'\r\n').encode('utf-8')) 

flag = s.recv(1024).decode()
print(flag)
s.close()

```

## Networking
### ERROR REPORTING PROTOCOL
#### Instruction
​    Download the tcpdump file and identify the flag hidden within the error messages of this ICMP traffic.

#### Analysis

1. Find where and what the error is.
    ![01](/public/blog-imgs/247ctf/01.png)

2. Why error ?

   In `echo(ping)`, `ICMP` uses `id` and `seq` to identify and match request and reply. Also, `ICMP` will try to match the `data` field between request and reply. Under default setting, those two data field are the same , as the name `echo` imply. So, if there is not a match for some req, it reports a warning.

3. What to do ? 

   Data in echo reply changed, so maybe some information is hidden in the payload. In Wireshark we can see the payload in echo request is "Send the flag !", and payload in the first reply have "JFIF" in it, which means reply is an image.
    ![02](/public/blog-imgs/247ctf/02.png)
    ![03](/public/blog-imgs/247ctf/03.png)
   Now we should concatenate all ICMP reply payloads to one file.

```python
# python3
import dpkt

in_pcap=open("error_reporting.pcap", "rb")

# going to extract all ICMP payloads and concatenate them in_pcap one file
output=open("output.jpg", "bw")
pcap=dpkt.pcap.Reader(in_pcap)

# The parsed packets in the dpkt.pcap.Reader contains two members: "ts" and "buf".
# The member "ts" is just the timestamp which lived in_pcap the packet when captured
# by Wireshark; it is the clock when captured this packet. The member "buf" holds
# the real packet data captured by capture tool, it's the raw traffic data.
for ts, buf in pcap:
    eth=dpkt.ethernet.Ethernet(buf)
    if (eth.type != 2048): # 2048 is the code for IPv4
        continue

    ip=eth.data
    icmp=ip.data

    if (ip.p==dpkt.ip.IP_PROTO_ICMP) and len(icmp.data.data)>0:
        output.write(icmp.data.data)

in_pcap.close()
output.close()

```

Now we get the img and can see flag after opening it .

### Not my Modulus
#### Instruction
We are trying to decrypt a packet capture taken on our internal network. We know you can decrypt the data using the correct private key, but we simply have too many. Can you identify the correct key? (pcap file and many private keys provided.)

#### Analysis
1. Where is the target data ?
  Two stages in TLS have encrypted data. 

  | stage                     | encrypted data                                     | key                                  |
  | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
  | application data transfer | application data                                   | session key<br />(can't be captured) |
  | handshake                 | PreMaster secret<br />(for session key generating) | server public key                    |
  | handshake                 | encrypted handshake message                        | session key                          |

  I know flag can be in application data, but ``not sure`` if it can be hidden in handshake premaster or encrypted handshake msg. Fortunately, all three above can be decrypted cause we are provided the server private key.

2. how to decrypt ?

   Premaster secret can be decrypted using correct private key, and what's better is that wireshark can compute session keys as well given the private key.

3. how to match RSA key pairs ?

   ``` shell
   #!/bin/bash
   
   PUB_KEY_MODULUS=$(openssl x509 -inform der -in cert.der -noout -modulus | openssl md5 )
   echo $PUB_KEY_MODULUS
   for filename in keys/*; do
       PRIVATE_KEY_MODULUS=$(openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in $filename | openssl md5)
       if [ "$PUB_KEY_MODULUS" = "$PRIVATE_KEY_MODULUS" ]; then
           echo
           echo $filename
       fi
       break
   done
   
   ```

   

4. how to decrypt packets in wireshark ?

   Details in [8]. One thing important is that the`` debug file`` field is better not left empty. Even given wrong actual tls port, wireshark can print correct decrypted data in the debug file.

#### Some confusions when solving
Q1: In the pcap file I see Encrypt Alert before TCP FIN, and if looking into it ,I see "Content Type: Alert(21)" in wireshark. When refering to RFC 5246, I see in section 7.2 Alert "decryption_failed_RESERVED(21)" . So why decryption failed in this pcap, what happened ?
A1: Actually I've mistaken the meaning of "Content Type: Alert(21)". It means "The higher-level protocol used to process the enclosed fragment."[3]. In other words, it says that part is an alert, but the alert is encrypted, so we can't see the alert type.

### Multiplication Tables

#### Instruction

Can you recover the private key we used to download the flag over a TLS encrypted connection?





## WEB

### Trusted Client

#### Instruction

Developers don't always have time to setup a backend service when prototyping code. Storing credentials on the client side should be fine as long as it's obfuscated right?

#### Analysis

1. What info we can get now : 

``` shell
1. "obfuscated" must imply something.
2. We can see long strange characters in JS.
3. Input any username and pass, an alert occurs. But see the JS, no "alert" is found. So there must be something executed in the strange JS. Actually the js  is obfuscated.
```

2. Next we should know know what obfuscated algo used. After searching, we know it's JSFuck.

   So just find an online decoder(Be careful that the obfuscated js code you copy may have spaces, you should delete them by using regular expression and replace ``\s`` to ``\0``). en 

   Then we get the flag.
